num1 = 5
num2 = 10
result = num1 + num2

print(result)
print(num1 + num2) # sum
print(num1 - num2) # subtraction
print(num1 // num2) # division
print(num1 % num2) # rest of division
print(num1 * num2) # multiplication
print(num1 ** num2) # potency


# if you want to add sum or subtract some value from a variable:

product = 10
product += 5 # augmented assignment operator
print(product) # the variable will be already changed using that function
# this can be used with any math operator
